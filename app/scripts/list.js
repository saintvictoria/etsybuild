The box is still in really good condition and was bought from Child&#39;s World which has been gone for awhile in New England.  We put Twinkle Twinkle Little Star in and let it played through to the end and it did fine.  Not only do you get Twinkle Twinkle you also get London Bridge, Hickory Dickory Dock, Edelweiss, Oh Where Has my Little Dog Gone,Jack and Jill, Humpty Dumpty and Children&#39;s Marching Song and each record is in a bright cheerful color.  The record player itself is in good condition with no flaws that we could see and all you toy collectors if you don&#39;t have one of these in your collection here is a real good one...\r\n\r\nAny questions ask away...",

"description": "vintage fisher-price record player in great condition. This is a model 825 made in 1978.\r\nThe record player works like it should. I would recommend getting a new needle for it if you plan on using it regularly or using it on scratched up records. The first record I put on it was pretty scratched up and it skipped quite a bit. I then put a really nice record on it and it played it fine, but there was still a little bit of skipping every now and then which means the needle is not in the best of shape. Needles can be purchased for this online still. This record player has two speeds for 33&#39;s and 45&#39;s.\r\nFREE SHIPPING!!!!!!!",

I can gladly help you out.\r\n\r\nAll purchases are shipped 1-2 business days after payment. \r\n\r\n\r\nInternational Shipping:\r\nI do offer international shipping for many countries.

Please note that I do not work Friday through Sunday so I will not be available to check emails and I cannot ship orders out on those days. Custom orders and large orders DO require more shipping and creating time, and I may have to order specialty colors if you request something I do not have in stock. Please allow 2-6 weeks for custom orders.  I ship in the order that the items sell in, so if you need a package by a deadline you need to write a note to me in the notes to seller at checkout and I will accommodate you as best as I can.  Summer and Fall is a very busy time for me as I also create beach glass jewelry and sell at art shows, some of which I have to travel to get to, so shipping may be delayed.  Again, if you need an item by a deadline, write a note to seller at checkout.\r\n\r\nI am proud to announce that my vintage items are now featured at a prominent antique retailer in my home town!  This means that items may sell there before they sell here, but I will keep on top of it as best as I can.  If two people purchase the same item, it will go to the in store buyer at the local shop.\r\n\r\nI use preused and recycled packing material and boxes whenever possible, please respect our beautiful Earth and recycle or reuse them again.  Packing peanuts made from styrofoam never break down, so please do not just throw them out!  If you cannot find an alternative, just ship them back to me and I will reuse them.\r\n \r\nUnited States:\r\nOrders will be shipped via USPS first class or the lowest cost alternative. You will receive an automated email from Etsy that will confirm your shipment and will include a tracking number.\r\n \r\nUSA Orders are shipped with confirmation. I do not make money on shipping. The price covers the cost of shipping and handling only. Once the items are out of my hands, I are not responsible for lost or damaged items so I strongly recommend you purchase insurance for valuable items. (See below for more details.)\r\n \r\nInternational Orders are shipped First Class. All orders will have receipt confirmation, and if you would like to purchase tracking or insurance, just let me know in advance. Please note that orders shipped outside of the US can take 6 weeks to arrive. If you would like delivery confirmation, please convo me.  If you are an international buyer, you NEED to convo me prior to purchase for a shipping quote.\r\n \r\nADDRESS: I ship to the address listed on Etsy. Please let me know if you want item shipped to different address, or if you want the items gift-wrapped (extra charges apply).  It is your responsibility to make sure that your shipping address is accurate!  If an item is returned to me because your address was incorrect, it is your responsibility to repay for shipping to send the item back to you.  Refunds will not be given due to invalid address.",
"policy_refunds": "If for any reason you are unsatisfied with your purchase, please convo me within 48 hours with a full explanation, and I will do my very best to solve the issue. I take great pride in my work, and hope that your pieces arrive safely and in the condition I shipped them in.\r\n \r\nI DO NOT CANCEL ORDERS.  Please ask all questions before you make your purchase, I will not cancel an order, even if it has not shipped yet.  This is because when you order an item, it is pulled from my retail store&#39;s shelf and you are committed to purchasing it.\r\n\r\nReturns are generally not allowed, so please make sure you read the details if the items and ask all questions prior to purchase. Returns must be requested via convo prior to shipping the item back to me. In the rare case that I allow a return, items MUST be returned in the same packaging in which you received them. Shipping costs cannot be refunded.  Vintage items are not returnable.\r\n \r\nCustom orders cannot be refunded, but every reasonable effort will be made to ensure you are involved with the creative process so that you are happy with the result.",

That means if it is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to opt for insurance on your package. Lost or damaged packages that are uninsured will NOT be refunded. Per Etsy&#39;s policy: &quot;Etsy cannot hold sellers responsible for items lost or delayed int he mail, as long as they have shipped the item according to the Etsy transaction receipt&quot;.  Again, neither Etsy nor Northodox will be held responsible for damaged or lost packages, and they will not refund your money in such an event.  Please make sure your address is correct!  I ship through Etsy to the address listed.  If your item is returned to me due to an insufficient address, it is your responsibility to pay for shipping for the correct address.  Refunds will NOT be given due to an incorrect address.\r\n",

Since becoming engaged this summer, I have decided to CLOSE MY SHOP to allow me to focus on planning our wedding.

"policy_payment": "I only accept Direct Checkout through Etsy as payment. Payment is due upon purchase.\r\n \r\nI apologize to Minnesota residents, but we have to collect the Duluth St. Louis County tax rate of 7.875% for all purchases.\r\n",
"policy_shipping": "I ship Mon-Thurs since Etsy makes it super convenient to just print and ship! Please note that I do not work Friday through Sunday so I will not be available to check emails and I cannot ship orders out on those days. Custom orders and large orders DO require more shipping and creating time, and I may have to order specialty colors if you request something I do not have in stock. Please allow 2-6 weeks for custom orders.  I ship in the order that the items sell in, so if you need a package by a deadline you need to write a note to me in the notes to seller at checkout and I will accommodate you as best as I can.  Summer and Fall is a very busy time for me as I also create beach glass jewelry and sell at art shows, some of which I have to travel to get to, so shipping may be delayed.  Again, if you need an item by a deadline, write a note to seller at checkout.\r\n\r\nI am proud to announce that my vintage items are now featured at a prominent antique retailer in my home town!  This means that items may sell there before they sell here, but I will keep on top of it as best as I can.  If two people purchase the same item, it will go to the in store buyer at the local shop.\r\n\r\nI use preused and recycled packing material and boxes whenever possible, please respect our beautiful Earth and recycle or reuse them again.  Packing peanuts made from styrofoam never break down, so please do not just throw them out!  If you cannot find an alternative, just ship them back to me and I will reuse them.\r\n \r\nUnited States:\r\nOrders will be shipped via USPS first class or the lowest cost alternative. You will receive an automated email from Etsy that will confirm your shipment and will include a tracking number.\r\n \r\nUSA Orders are shipped with confirmation. I do not make money on shipping. The price covers the cost of shipping and handling only. Once the items are out of my hands, I are not responsible for lost or damaged items so I strongly recommend you purchase insurance for valuable items. (See below for more details.)\r\n \r\nInternational Orders are shipped First Class. All orders will have receipt confirmation, and if you would like to purchase tracking or insurance, just let me know in advance. Please note that orders shipped outside of the US can take 6 weeks to arrive. If you would like delivery confirmation, please convo me.  If you are an international buyer, you NEED to convo me prior to purchase for a shipping quote.\r\n \r\nADDRESS: I ship to the address listed on Etsy. Please let me know if you want item shipped to different address, or if you want the items gift-wrapped (extra charges apply).  It is your responsibility to make sure that your shipping address is accurate!  If an item is returned to me because your address was incorrect, it is your responsibility to repay for shipping to send the item back to you.  Refunds will not be given due to invalid address.",
"policy_refunds": "If for any reason you are unsatisfied with your purchase, please convo me within 48 hours with a full explanation, and I will do my very best to solve the issue. I take great pride in my work, and hope that your pieces arrive safely and in the condition I shipped them in.\r\n \r\nI DO NOT CANCEL ORDERS.  Please ask all questions before you make your purchase, I will not cancel an order, even if it has not shipped yet.  This is because when you order an item, it is pulled from my retail store&#39;s shelf and you are committed to purchasing it.\r\n\r\nReturns are generally not allowed, so please make sure you read the details if the items and ask all questions prior to purchase. Returns must be requested via convo prior to shipping the item back to me. In the rare case that I allow a return, items MUST be returned in the same packaging in which you received them. Shipping costs cannot be refunded.  Vintage items are not returnable.\r\n \r\nCustom orders cannot be refunded, but every reasonable effort will be made to ensure you are involved with the creative process so that you are happy with the result.",

On occasion the USPS will not accept your listed address and gives me a preferred choice which I will use to get the label generated. This usually involves the way you&#39;ve written a suite or apartment number. If the package returns due to unknown, error, incorrect address, you are responsible to pay additional shipping cost to re-send. \r\n\r\nI ship once a week which is Monday and sometime Friday (except for holidays) via USPS first class, standard and media mail with delivery confirmation included. You may request a shipping upgrade. I will work with you to make sure that you receive your item(s) in a timely and safe manner.\r\n\r\n*Note* My income is based on my item for sale not by inflating shipping costs. If the shipping costs are significantly less than I have calculated I WILL refund this difference to you. I will fully refund $5.00 and up, likewise I keep the change for shipping and handling. \r\n\r\nDomestic purchases over $100.00 receive a complimentary upgrade to priority shipping.\r\n\r\nRefunds and Exchanges:\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that you are purchasing vintage and antique pieces that are more than 20 years old. I have taken great care to select only gently used items and I carefully inspect each piece before listing and again while packaging them for shipment. If there are any sizable scratches or wear on the merchandise I will note this and photograph it for you to view before you purchase it. If you are not satisfied with your purchase please notify me within 3 days of receipt and I will do everything I can to help. Again, please be sure you read the description and examine the photos carefully before you order.\r\n\r\nRefund:\r\n\r\nAre issued less shipping costs, and the item must be mailed within 3 days of notification. \r\nThe item must be returned via USPS in it&#39;s original packaging, insured for the full amount of the purchase price with delivery confirmation. \r\nBuyer is responsible for return shipping costs. \r\nThe item must be returned in the same condition as when it was shipped to you.\r\n\r\nIn case of damage or loss during shipping, please notify me immediately upon receipt of the parcel, and I will provide you with information regarding filing a claim with USPS. *Do not return items damaged in shipping before contacting me, as doing so will void the shipping insurance. Be sure to keep all original packaging, as well as all pieces of the damaged item. *USPS will ask to examine the parcel when the claim is filed.\r\n\r\nUSPS requires a waiting period of 30 days from the date of mailing before filing a claim for lost items. If you have not received your parcel within reasonable period of time after receiving notice of shipment, please email me to report this problem. USPS may ask to review all email correspondence between the buyer and the seller to confirm the details.\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nAdditional Policies and FAQs\r\nMy goal is customer satisfaction.
